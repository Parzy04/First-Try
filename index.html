    <body>
        Hello, everybody, this is my first attempt at building a webpage from scratch using just HTML and CSS code.
        The body of this webpage is not important, what is important is the tables and pictures that I will try to include!
        Enjoy!
    </body>
    <table>
        <h2>Apex Characters</h2>
            <tr>
                <th>Support</th>
                <th>Damage Per Second</th>
                <th>Tanks</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pathfinder</td>
                <td>Lifeline</td>
                <td>Bloodhound</td>
                <td>Crypto</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Wraith</td>
